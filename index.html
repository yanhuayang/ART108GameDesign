          <h5>Tappy Dragon</h5>
         <li>Game Credit</li>
         <p>
          We used Piskel to make patterns of the game including: background image, little dragon, poles with different colors. The musics are about three such beep for tap, one is for counting scores, another is for the game is over. </p>
         <li>Game Introduction</li>
         <p>
          To start the game first with countdown for 3 seconds. When the dragon falling from the top of the screen, tapping mousepad to control it in position without colliding with any poles. The score will count as every pole the dragon goes through. If dragon collides the pole will die and start the game from the beginning again. It is a little big hard because you have to tap neight hard no light to keep the dragon flowting in the middle of the two poles to get highest score; otherwise, it will die quickly. </p>
         <li>Game Issues</li>
         <p>There is no time limits, the only goal is to get highest scores without ending. The dragon has no enemies at all, and the poles are it's only enemy. No obvious rewards for the players and only one level but very challenged.</p>

          <h5>**Game Name: Shooting Dragon**</h5>
         <li>Digital Prototype</li>
        
         In this game, you control the dragon which will be flying through the gap between two poles, and the enemy will be there accordingly between poles. You can shoot the enemy to go forward. The goal is to continuing to fly without colliding with enemies and poles till you collide.
         <li>Process of Creating the Game</li>
         I am the artist responsible all the pictorial patterns in the game such as background picture, protagonist, enemy, barriers, and click bottoms. I sent all of them to the programar when finished designed patterns. We met three times at library to discuss wheather we should change mechanics or the designs. It was very cooperated and fun. 
          

         <li>My Role: Producer</li>
         The most important job is to organize the whole game developing provess. My work is to make the burndown chart which tracking the developing process of the designer. I need to make sure to ask the designer what did the designer accomplish yesterday, what do the designer plan to accomplish today, and what obstacles might get in his way when we meet. I make plan to meet designer during the developing process, estimate the time, and tell him the deadline of the game. 

         <li>Two of the Playtest Secssion</li>
         I got two playtester's responses, who were Ariana an Jillian. Aliana like the game because it is simple with very good visual impact. She wouldn't certain how to move the main character, but she like the design. Jillian thoguht it was cute with good mechanics. She thought it is similar game with Falappy Bird, but she asked me to change the desin of the spaces about the game, because she was sure that it was hard to win the game. 


         <li>Plan to Change</li>
         I might change the main character to make it bigger and obvious. ALso, I wanted to change the pole to smaller or add more of it as well.

 <h4>Session Report: [of Game 2]</h4>
 <p>

  We started out the basic game setup, this time with 7 people, making it so that we would have 3 spies in our group.</p>

  <li>Round 1</li>
  <p>
The first round went fairly fast since everyone understood what to do and outing themselves as a spy this early was a bad move. </p>

<li>Captain: Johnny </li>
<li>Mission: Yanhua & Krystal</li>
<p>

Everyone unanimously accepted the decision, except Antony, who rejected it out of fun. That aside, we chose our decisions, and revealed them both. The mission was a success. No suspicious activity just yet.</p>

 <li>Round 2</li>

<li>Captain: Jillian</li>
<li>Mission: Mikhail, Vanessa, Jillian</li>
<p>
Another unanimous approved vote, and the mission goers picked their cards and the pile was shuffled. The outcome was a fail, as one out of the three cards was revealed to be a fail. With that the debate started on who would potentially be a spy.</p>

  <li>Round 3</li>
<li>Captain: Antony</li>
<li>Mission: Antony, Mikhail & Vanessa</li>
<p>
Since a majority of the votes on the approval voting, the mission was approved. The mission outcome was a success. Suspicions rose. The plan between the whole group was to change one factor in the group from round 2 to see if we could weed out people on being a spy. However, this plan was discussed when choosing those who would go on the mission, making the spies aware what was going to happen. 
</p>

<li>Round 4</li>
<li>Captain: Mikhail</li>
<li>Mission: Krystal, Jillian, Mikhail, Antony</li>
<p>
Mission was approved, but some people rejected out of suspicion of those who were chosen. However, since the majority was approve, the mission proceeded. The outcome was a Fail with two fails. With this outcome, people in the group started to defend themselves as to why theyâ€™re not a spy and some started to shove suspicion onto other members who went previously. We recollected who went last and thought through the major suspects and some possibilities.</p>


<li>Round 5</li>
<li>Captan: Yanhua</li>
<li>Mission: Yanhua, Krystal, Antony, Mikhail</li>
<p>
Final round, everyone was on edge since it was now a 2-2 resistance traitor tie. A majority of the team voted for the mission to go through, some people rejected and debated why, but the mission went on. Before the decision was set, there was a split between choosing Antony and Vanessa. Jillian was speculated to be a spy the most out of most of the group at this point of the game. The last set of success/fail cards were chosen and shuffled.
<br>
Prior to showing the cards, Jillian revealed herself to be a spy, and then Vanessa revealed herself to be part of the resistance. The group loses it and the cards were revealed to have a fail card in the pile. The spies had won.</p>

         <li>Index cards</li>
         <li>A larg white paper</li>
         <li>Mark Pen</li>
         I am going to briefly explain the basic card game with two players. There are 10 squres on the white page with 2 tokens with RED color is Helen and BLUE color is Abby. Shuffling the card thoroughly in order not to be manipulated by any of the players. Remove the jokers and leave the rest of the cards as a deck on the right top.
         <li>Rule 1: give each player 7 cards to start the game.</li>
         <li>Rule 2: Rock, paper, sessors to decide which player goes first.</li>

          <P>The achievement of this game is to see which player moves the token from bottom left of the map to the top right first. Helen goes first with "A", Abby follows with "K", but Helen does not have any cards that are larger than "K", so the first round Abby is the winner. She moved her token forward to the second square.
            <li>Rule 3: Whoever is the winner is always goes first in the upcoming round.</li>
            <li>Rule 4: After a round, both players need to grab cards from the deck in order to maintain 7 cards in hand, and the winner always the first one to grab the cards.</li>

          <P>The map shows Abby is the first to achieve the goal with her BLUE token on the top right of the map. Helen is backward two steps than her, but not bad. 
            <h5>Some tips to make the game more interesting </h5>
            <li>Grabing new cards from the left top deck is like the rewards, which can keep this game from getting bored in a short time.</li>
            <li>Each of the player can always play the largest card first to beat their rival in order to achieve the goal fast. </li>
            <li>When one player is luckier than another, it is better to give some chances to the rival, so they both can keep their interests and fun.</li>
