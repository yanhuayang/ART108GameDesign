 <h4>Session Report: [of Game 2]</h4>
 <p>

  We started out the basic game setup, this time with 7 people, making it so that we would have 3 spies in our group.</p>

  <li>Round 1</li>
  <p>
The first round went fairly fast since everyone understood what to do and outing themselves as a spy this early was a bad move. </p>

<li>Captain: Johnny </li>
<li>Mission: Yanhua & Krystal</li>
<p>

Everyone unanimously accepted the decision, except Antony, who rejected it out of fun. That aside, we chose our decisions, and revealed them both. The mission was a success. No suspicious activity just yet.</p>

 <li>Round 2</li>

<li>Captain: Jillian</li>
<li>Mission: Mikhail, Vanessa, Jillian</li>
<p>
Another unanimous approved vote, and the mission goers picked their cards and the pile was shuffled. The outcome was a fail, as one out of the three cards was revealed to be a fail. With that the debate started on who would potentially be a spy.</p>

  <li>Round 3</li>
<li>Captain: Antony</li>
<li>Mission: Antony, Mikhail & Vanessa</li>
<p>
Since a majority of the votes on the approval voting, the mission was approved. The mission outcome was a success. Suspicions rose. The plan between the whole group was to change one factor in the group from round 2 to see if we could weed out people on being a spy. However, this plan was discussed when choosing those who would go on the mission, making the spies aware what was going to happen. 
</p>

<li>Round 4</li>
<li>Captain: Mikhail</li>
<li>Mission: Krystal, Jillian, Mikhail, Antony</li>
<p>
Mission was approved, but some people rejected out of suspicion of those who were chosen. However, since the majority was approve, the mission proceeded. The outcome was a Fail with two fails. With this outcome, people in the group started to defend themselves as to why theyâ€™re not a spy and some started to shove suspicion onto other members who went previously. We recollected who went last and thought through the major suspects and some possibilities.</p>


<li>Round 5</li>
<li>Captan: Yanhua</li>
<li>Mission: Yanhua, Krystal, Antony, Mikhail</li>
<p>
Final round, everyone was on edge since it was now a 2-2 resistance traitor tie. A majority of the team voted for the mission to go through, some people rejected and debated why, but the mission went on. Before the decision was set, there was a split between choosing Antony and Vanessa. Jillian was speculated to be a spy the most out of most of the group at this point of the game. The last set of success/fail cards were chosen and shuffled.
<br>
Prior to showing the cards, Jillian revealed herself to be a spy, and then Vanessa revealed herself to be part of the resistance. The group loses it and the cards were revealed to have a fail card in the pile. The spies had won.</p>

          <h5>**Pictorial illustrations of game-play**</h5>
         <li>A pack of card</li>
         <li>Tokens: 2</li>
         <li>Index cards</li>
         <li>A larg white paper</li>
         <li>Mark Pen</li>
         I am going to briefly explain the basic card game with two players. There are 10 squres on the white page with 2 tokens with RED color is Helen and BLUE color is Abby. Shuffling the card thorouly in order not to be manipulated by any of the players. Reduce the jokers and leave the left cards as a derk on the right top.
         <li>Rule 1: give each player 7 cards to start the game.</li>
         <li>Rule 2: Rock, paper, sessors to decide which player goes first.</li>

          <P>The achievement of this game is to see which player moves the token from bottom left of the map to the top right first. Helen goes first with "A", Abby follows with "K", but Helen does not have any cards are larger than "K", so the first round Abby is the winner. She moved her token forward to the second square.
            <li>Rule 3: Whoever is the winner always goes first at the upcoming round.</li>
            <li>Rule 4: After a round, both players need to grap cards from the derk in order to maintain 7 cards in hand, and the winner always the first one to grap the cards.</li>

          <P>The map shows Abby is the first to achieve the goal with her BLUE token on the top right of the map. Helen is backward two steps than her, but not bad. 
            <h5>Some tips to make the game more interesting </h5>
            <li>Grap new cards from the left top derk is like the rewards, which can keep this game from getting bored in a short time.</li>
            <li>Each of the player can always play the largest card first to beat their rival in order to achieve the goal fast. </li>
            <li>When one player is luckier than another, it is better to give some chances to the rival, so they both can keep their interests and fun.</li>
