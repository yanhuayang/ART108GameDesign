          <h4>What did I learn?</h4>
          <p>
            As a brand new beginner to learn how to make a game at this class.
            <br> 
            I have learned the basic knowledge of making 2D game, which including write a story of the game, make a game as a art designer and producer, understand different genres of game, write session report, find different mechanics through playing the game, and try and play different types of games.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>What was most interesting</h4>
            <p>
              The most interesting part of learning to make a game is that we were playing board games at the first several classes together at class. It was an impressive experience for me because I have never played any other boardgames exepting chess. I have learned how to play "The Resistance" just for ten minutes. We talked about the game and had fun. After that we had to write a blog to explian the experience. One of the classmates wrote very significant and thoughtful blog about "The Secret Hitler", was one of my favorites.

            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Does this material seem connected</h4>
            <p>

              I was interested in reading the book because it is not only explaining the process of making game, but also telling us how to take responsibility when making games and the soical impacts of different types of games. I thought it is very important to know before becoming a game designer at gaming industial. It will lead us to have better decisions from critical thinking.

            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Did you "read about games, write about games, play games, and design games?"</h4>
            <p>
              I played the game "Side Quest of Love" completely today. It is made by Krystal Deh and Jillian Balaguer, and the Music is made by Kevin macleod. I really like the music, mechanics, and asthetic of the game. It is like virsual novel because you need to read all the texts when playing the game in order to know the contents. They have done every good job for everything perfectly demonstrating their effort and skills. I have learned to make 2D game as a designer, and all the pictures were made from the Piskel, is a very good software. I like the process when we separated groups to start and finish the game. After that, we played the game in class and exchanged to paly other's games as well. I have written a story of one of the games, which was to explian how AI technology made me feel unsecure. It is very connected with the world we are living now. To sum up, I felt it is a very good way to understand something when you do not really know but have bias toward to it.

          <li>Anthony Sokry: programmer and producer</li>
          <br>
         <h3>Mechanics and Experience of the Game</h3>
         <p>
          Our final game title is Spaceship repair. We wanted to create a 3D/3rd-person/shooter/survival game where the player needs to survive a given amount of time while fighting off invading alien zombies and maintaining three â€œfix itâ€ locations that always degrade over time, thus requiring lots of visits for fixing. The player would be able to shoot at the enemies and interact with the â€œfix itâ€ locations to keep it fixed where a small gauge indicates how operational it is. Players would accumulate points as the timer runs down. If the player has survived within the given time while having the three locations above a certain level of being fixed, the player wins, otherwise the player loses. And of course, if the playerâ€™s health hits zero, the player loses.
However, at its current state, the game is only a prototype where the player can only move and jump on a small platform shared with a single alien zombie. Our new goal is to have the enemy AI working with all its animations, and UI did such as points and health, as well as allowing the player to shoot and take damage. We also wanted to add a starting menu and losing screen/menu and allowing the possibility of winning and losing. We hope to get it to a minimum viable product.</p>

          <h5>Harry Potter Wizards Unite</h5>
         <li>Mechanics and Experience of the Game</li>
         <p>
          The mechanics of the game include walking, fighting, role play, various play power, and pattern recognition, etc.. First, we need to read the tutorial before starting the game. It is hard to understand with too many words. The second we have to chose one of the rooms to form a group. For example, I chose the Slytherin, and with other classmates who wanted the same room form a group by walking around the campus while playing the game together. When we were walking, the buildings would show on the map of the game — clicking the buildings to start to fight with monsters. Sometimes, some group members would show in the game when you were playing. It is like VR experience.</p>
          <br>
         <li>Peers Affect the Game</li>
         <p>
          Some of the peers do not like the game; they consider it is boring like pokemon one of the similar games. Some of the peers like to explore the places around them. I like the game and wanted to play more because it is like adventure together without feeling scared. We were talking and deciding what was next together. We discussed how to play the game to get more sense about how to play because some of us did not have any idea about what the game should be like and what are some rules or good methods should be employed to play it well. It was a good experience playing a game with the phone but combining with the real world. Nothing is better than this.</p>

          <h5>Tappy Dragon</h5>
         <li>Game Credit</li>
         <p>
          We used Piskel to make patterns of the game including: background image, little dragon, poles with different colors. The musics are about three such beep for tap, one is for counting scores, another is for the game is over. </p>
         <li>Game Introduction</li>
         <p>
          To start the game first with countdown for 3 seconds. When the dragon falling from the top of the screen, tapping mousepad to control it in position without colliding with any poles. The score will count as every pole the dragon goes through. If dragon collides the pole will die and start the game from the beginning again. It is a little big hard because you have to tap neight hard no light to keep the dragon flowting in the middle of the two poles to get highest score; otherwise, it will die quickly. </p>
         <li>Game Issues</li>
         <p>There is no time limits, the only goal is to get highest scores without ending. The dragon has no enemies at all, and the poles are it's only enemy. No obvious rewards for the players and only one level but very challenged.</p>

          <h5>**Game Name: Shooting Dragon**</h5>
         <li>Digital Prototype</li>
        
         In this game, you control the dragon which will be flying through the gap between two poles, and the enemy will be there accordingly between poles. You can shoot the enemy to go forward. The goal is to continuing to fly without colliding with enemies and poles till you collide.
         <li>Process of Creating the Game</li>
         I am the artist responsible all the pictorial patterns in the game such as background picture, protagonist, enemy, barriers, and click bottoms. I sent all of them to the programar when finished designed patterns. We met three times at library to discuss wheather we should change mechanics or the designs. It was very cooperated and fun. 
          

         <li>My Role: Producer</li>
         The most important job is to organize the whole game developing provess. My work is to make the burndown chart which tracking the developing process of the designer. I need to make sure to ask the designer what did the designer accomplish yesterday, what do the designer plan to accomplish today, and what obstacles might get in his way when we meet. I make plan to meet designer during the developing process, estimate the time, and tell him the deadline of the game. 

         <li>Two of the Playtest Secssion</li>
         I got two playtester's responses, who were Ariana an Jillian. Aliana like the game because it is simple with very good visual impact. She wouldn't certain how to move the main character, but she like the design. Jillian thoguht it was cute with good mechanics. She thought it is similar game with Falappy Bird, but she asked me to change the desin of the spaces about the game, because she was sure that it was hard to win the game. 


         <li>Plan to Change</li>
         I might change the main character to make it bigger and obvious. ALso, I wanted to change the pole to smaller or add more of it as well.

 <h4>Session Report: [of Game 2]</h4>
 <p>

  We started out the basic game setup, this time with 7 people, making it so that we would have 3 spies in our group.</p>

  <li>Round 1</li>
  <p>
The first round went fairly fast since everyone understood what to do and outing themselves as a spy this early was a bad move. </p>

<li>Captain: Johnny </li>
<li>Mission: Yanhua & Krystal</li>
<p>

Everyone unanimously accepted the decision, except Antony, who rejected it out of fun. That aside, we chose our decisions, and revealed them both. The mission was a success. No suspicious activity just yet.</p>

 <li>Round 2</li>

<li>Captain: Jillian</li>
<li>Mission: Mikhail, Vanessa, Jillian</li>
<p>
Another unanimous approved vote, and the mission goers picked their cards and the pile was shuffled. The outcome was a fail, as one out of the three cards was revealed to be a fail. With that the debate started on who would potentially be a spy.</p>

  <li>Round 3</li>
<li>Captain: Antony</li>
<li>Mission: Antony, Mikhail & Vanessa</li>
<p>
Since a majority of the votes on the approval voting, the mission was approved. The mission outcome was a success. Suspicions rose. The plan between the whole group was to change one factor in the group from round 2 to see if we could weed out people on being a spy. However, this plan was discussed when choosing those who would go on the mission, making the spies aware what was going to happen. 
</p>

<li>Round 4</li>
<li>Captain: Mikhail</li>
<li>Mission: Krystal, Jillian, Mikhail, Antony</li>
<p>
Mission was approved, but some people rejected out of suspicion of those who were chosen. However, since the majority was approve, the mission proceeded. The outcome was a Fail with two fails. With this outcome, people in the group started to defend themselves as to why they’re not a spy and some started to shove suspicion onto other members who went previously. We recollected who went last and thought through the major suspects and some possibilities.</p>


<li>Round 5</li>
<li>Captan: Yanhua</li>
<li>Mission: Yanhua, Krystal, Antony, Mikhail</li>
<p>
Final round, everyone was on edge since it was now a 2-2 resistance traitor tie. A majority of the team voted for the mission to go through, some people rejected and debated why, but the mission went on. Before the decision was set, there was a split between choosing Antony and Vanessa. Jillian was speculated to be a spy the most out of most of the group at this point of the game. The last set of success/fail cards were chosen and shuffled.
<br>
Prior to showing the cards, Jillian revealed herself to be a spy, and then Vanessa revealed herself to be part of the resistance. The group loses it and the cards were revealed to have a fail card in the pile. The spies had won.</p>

         I am going to briefly explain the basic card game with two players. There are 10 squres on the white page with 2 tokens with RED color is Helen and BLUE color is Abby. Shuffling the card thoroughly in order not to be manipulated by any of the players. Remove the jokers and leave the rest of the cards as a deck on the right top.
         <li>Rule 1: give each player 7 cards to start the game.</li>

            <li>Grabing new cards from the left top deck is like the rewards, which can keep this game from getting bored in a short time.</li>
            <li>Each of the player can always play the largest card first to beat their rival in order to achieve the goal fast. </li>
