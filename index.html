          <P>The internet arcade game names: Congo Bongo produced by Japan in 1983. As a brand-new game player without familaring with those keys and mouse, I felt a little bit of a challenge. I played a few times still stopped at the first level . The first level is that the protagonist has to climb up the peak of the mountain to achieve his goal by fighting with his enemy. He has to dodge many coconuts thrown at him by his enemy from the mountaintop. If the protagonist is hit by coconut, the score will be lower. There are only three chances to get it started again; otherwise, the game is over. When climbing the large scales of steps or cross the river, I failed.
      It is a fun game. I remembered I payed the similar games with big old-fashioned machine at the gameroom when I was a child. The  machine was so much easier to control than my laptop, but I am not sure if it is much easier if I have one of the emulator.I will explore more.

         <li>A pack of card</li>
         <li>Tokens: 2</li>
         <li>Index cards</li>
         <li>A larg white paper</li>
         <li>Mark Pen</li>
         I am going to briefly explain the basic card game with two players. There are 10 squres on the white page with 2 tokens with RED color is Helen and BLUE color is Abby. Shuffling the card thorouly in order not to be manipulated by any of the players. Reduce the jokers and leave the left cards as a derk on the right top.
         <li>Rule 1: give each player 7 cards to start the game.</li>
         <li>Rule 2: Rock, paper, sessors to decide which player goes first.</li>

          <P>The achievement of this game is to see which player moves the token from bottom left of the map to the top right first. Helen goes first with "A", Abby follows with "K", but Helen does not have any cards are larger than "K", so the first round Abby is the winner. She moved her token forward to the second square.
            <li>Rule 3: Whoever is the winner always goes first at the upcoming round.</li>
            <li>Rule 4: After a round, both players need to grap cards from the derk in order to maintain 7 cards in hand, and the winner always the first one to grap the cards.</li>

          <P>The map shows Abby is the first to achieve the goal with her BLUE token on the top right of the map. Helen is backward two steps than her, but not bad. 
            <h5>Some tips to make the game more interesting </h5>
            <li>Grap new cards from the left top derk is like the rewards, which can keep this game from getting bored in a short time.</li>
            <li>Each of the player can always play the largest card first to beat their rival in order to achieve the goal fast. </li>
            <li>When one player is luckier than another, it is better to give some chances to the rival, so they both can keep their interests and fun.</li>
