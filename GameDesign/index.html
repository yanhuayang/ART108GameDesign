		The internet arcade game names: Congo Bongo produced by Japan in 1983. As a brand-new game player without familaring with those keys and mouse, I felt a little bit of a challenge. I played a few times still stopped at the first level . The first level is that the protagonist has to climb up the peak of the mountain to achieve his goal by fighting with his enemy. He has to dodge many coconuts thrown at him by his enemy from the mountaintop. If the protagonist is hit by coconut, the score will be lower. There are only three chances to get it started again; otherwise, the game is over. When climbing the large scales of steps or cross the river, I failed.
      It is a fun game. I remembered I payed the similar games with big old-fashioned machine at the gameroom when I was a child. The  machine was so much easier to control than my laptop, but I am not sure if it is much easier if I have one of the emulator.I will explore more.
